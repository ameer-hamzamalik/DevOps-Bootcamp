## 1. Linux Basic Commands Practiced

| Command | Description                    |
| ------- | ------------------------------ |
| `pwd`   | Show current working directory |
| `ls`    | List files and directories     |
| `cd`    | Change directory               |
| `mkdir` | Create a directory             |
| `touch` | Create an empty file           |
| `cat`   | Display file contents          |
| `clear` | Clear terminal screen          |
| `cp`    | Copy files or directories      |
| `mv`    | Move or rename files           |

## 2. User and Group Management

### Create a group

```bash
sudo groupadd devteam
```

### Create users with home directory and bash shell

```bash
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash alice
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash bob
```

### Add users to the group

```bash
sudo usermod -aG devteam alice
sudo usermod -aG devteam bob
```

### Set user passwords

```bash
echo "alice:password" | sudo chpasswd
```

---

## 3. File and Directory Setup

### Create project directory and file

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /srv/project
echo "Top Secret Project File" | sudo tee /srv/project/data.txt
```

### Change group ownership

```bash
sudo chown :devteam /srv/project/data.txt
```

### Set file permissions

```bash
sudo chmod 600 /srv/project/data.txt
```

**Result:**

- Only the file owner can read and write
    
- Group and others have no access

## 4. Permissions Task Summary

✔ Created users and groups  
✔ Managed file ownership and permissions  
✔ Debugged “Permission denied” issues  
✔ Applied correct permissions and verified access

---

## 5. Crontab Practice

### View cron jobs

```bash
crontab -l
```

### Check backup log

```bash
cat ~/backup_status.txt
```

### Cron job entry

```bash
* * * * * /usr/local/bin/backup.sh >> /home/youruser/backup_status.txt 2>&1
```

### Explanation of redirection

- `0` → input
    
- `1` → output
    
- `2` → error
    
- `2>&1` redirects errors to the same file as output
    

### Cron time format

```
* * * * *
│ │ │ │ │
│ │ │ │ └── Day of week (0–7)
│ │ │ └──── Month (1–12)
│ │ └────── Day of month (1–31)
│ └──────── Hour (0–23)
└────────── Minute (0–59)
```

### Nano shortcuts used

- `CTRL + O` → Save (write out)
    
- `CTRL + X` → Exit
